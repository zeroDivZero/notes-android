# OVERVIEW

App -> (info & allowed actions) -> A11y framework (`AccessibilityNodeInfo`, `AccessibilityEvent`, `contentDescription`, etc.) -> (generic representation of info & allowed actions) -> `AccessibilityService` (app such as **TalkBack** that presents in way to fit user's a11y needs)

Dependended by often UI testing frameworks, such as Android's own **UI Automator**.

A11y draws in window on top of all windows. Can replace parts of UI with custom ones, at perf cost.
